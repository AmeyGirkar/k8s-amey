## üîç What is Kubernetes?

### Overview
- **Definition**: Open-source container orchestration platform
- **Origin**: Developed by Google, now maintained by CNCF
- **Purpose**: Automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

### Key Benefits
- Container Lifecycle Management
- High Availability
- Scalability
- Automated Deployment and Rollbacks
- Resource Optimization

## üõ† Use Cases

### Deployment Scenarios
1. Microservices Architecture
2. CI/CD Pipelines
3. Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Deployments
4. Big Data and Machine Learning Workloads

## üîç Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- Automated Bin Packing
- Service Discovery and Load Balancing
- Storage Orchestration
- Self-Healing
- Horizontal Scaling
- Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks
- Secret and Configuration Management

## üì¶ Kubernetes Architecture

### Node Types
- **Master Node (Control Plane)**
- **Worker Nodes**

### Control Plane Components

#### 1. API Server
- Central communication hub
- Handles all API requests
- Authenticates and authorizes users
- Validates REST commands
- Ensures configuration consistency

#### 2. ETCD
- Distributed key-value store
- Cluster state database
- Stores:
  - Node information
  - Configurations
  - Secrets
  - Access controls
- Implements cluster-wide locks

#### 3. Control Manager
- Cluster state management
- Monitors and responds to cluster events
- Manages various controllers
- Ensures desired cluster state

#### 4. Scheduler
- Assigns pods to worker nodes
- Considers:
  - Resource availability
  - Constraints
  - Node capacity

### Worker Node Components

#### 1. Kubelet
- Node-level container management agent
- Communicates with master components
- Creates and monitors pods
- Provides node health information

#### 2. Kube-Proxy
- Network rule management
- Enables inter-pod communication
- Handles service traffic routing

#### 3. Container Runtime
- Executes containers
- Supports multiple runtimes:
  - Docker
  - containerd
  - CRI-O

**Disclaimer**: Configurations may vary based on specific infrastructure and use cases.
